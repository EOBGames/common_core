The Lizards

Description:
The lizards have been one of humanity's greatest rivals on the galactic stage since first contact 160 years ago. The first contact between humans and lizards was humanity's first discovery of sentient life in the galaxy, and sparked the First Human/Lizard War (also known as the First Contact War). Since then, humanity has fought several wars with the lizards, with relations only beginning to improve following the final Human/Lizard War which ended in 2455. Now, the two maintain cordial relations, with Terragov hosting several embassies throughout lizard space and vice versa.

The lizards originally hail from Tizira, in the Rizkalon system, though throughout their two centuries in the stars prior to meeting humanity they spread over several planets and systems. This outward expansion was hindered by a lack of plasma and bluespace resources in their local area, stunting their technological advancement and therefore their development of effective FTL engines, first discovering them a mere decade before the First Contact War. Their technological level remains below that of their human rivals, due to a limited transfer of ideas between the two species.

Tizira is notably more arid than Earth, with smaller oceans and less arable land. In addition, the planet has a diminished ozone layer, leading to higher-than-average levels of solar radiation reaching the planet's surface. As cold blooded creatures, the lizards thrive in this environment, with major cities being built close to the coastlines and smaller settlements spread across the wide drylands and deserts.

Lizard society emphasises strict militarism and a rigid caste system. The caste system limits social mobility, separating society into distinct bands- however, as with many things in lizard society, enlistment in the military can change this. The military is intertwined deeply into lizard culture- all must serve a tour of mandatory service in the army after coming of age, it is customary for every citizen to be armed (typically with a blade, but into the modern era firearms have become commonplace), and the sight of a soldier on every street corner is not only typical but expected. Advancing in the military heirarchy is one of the few ways a low caste lizard might hope to raise his social standing.

As one travels further from Rizkalon however this culture softens. Nearly 2 centuries of contact with humanity and a limited projection of power from Tizira has made lizards on the frontier of the empire much more humanlike in their mannerisms. There are many lizards alive today who have never lived within the borders of the empire, and care little for its customs.

Religious beliefs are important to the Lizards, with a variety across the planet. The government is secular, with freedom of religion afforded to all. Of the entire population of the Empire, approximately 68% believe in a higher power. This number, as with many things in the empire, is concentrated most densely at the centre and diminishes as you travel further. In the furthest colonies, the lizards have enough to deal with in the here-and-now to worry about religion.
